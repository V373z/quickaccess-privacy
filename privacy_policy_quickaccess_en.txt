Privacy Policy – Quick Access
Effective as of: 2025-08-17

Summary
Quick Access displays advertising via Google AdMob. Your own items (e.g., links, names, categories, app settings) are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our own servers.

In the EU/UK/CH, only non‑personalized ads (NPA) are currently served. A consent dialog (CMP/UMP) is not shown at this time.

What data does the app process?
1) Local app data (stays on device)
Your entries: links, names, categories, favorites
App settings (layout, sorting, theme, etc.)
2) Processing by Google AdMob (ads)
To deliver, measure, and improve ads, Google (AdMob) may process in particular:

Advertising ID (Android Advertising ID) and possibly other device identifiers
IP address and approximate location (e.g., country/region)
Device and app information (model, OS version, app version, language)
Usage/event data (e.g., ad impressions, clicks, errors)
Diagnostics and performance data
Ad personalization is disabled. Non‑personalized ads (NPA) may still use technical identifiers for frequency capping, fraud prevention, and reach measurement.

Sharing with third parties
For advertising purposes, data is shared with Google (AdMob) and, where applicable, its ad partners. We do not use our own servers.

Permissions
Quick Access does not request sensitive permissions such as contacts, location, microphone, or camera. Network access is required to serve ads and open external links.

Donation link (Buy Me a Coffee)
The app contains an optional donation link that opens in the external browser. No personal data is processed by the app for this. Any subsequent processing (e.g., IP address, cookies/trackers, payment data) is carried out solely by Buy Me a Coffee. See their privacy policy: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/privacy-policy.

Children
The app is not directed to children under the age of 13.

Changes
This privacy policy may be updated. Material changes will be indicated in the app and/or in the store listing.

Contact
For privacy inquiries, please use the developer contact email provided in the Google Play listing.

Note: If a consent dialog (CMP/UMP) is introduced in the future, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
